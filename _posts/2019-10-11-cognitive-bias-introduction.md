# Cognitive biases

## What are cognitive biases? 

To put it simply, a cognitive bias is an error in the reasoning process that impacts our choices, perceptions and judgments.

When we make a choice, we sometime take mental shortcuts and make the choice without any conscious deliberations, allowing us to free brain space for other (more demanding) activities. And that is a good thing. If we were to consciously consider every single choice in our life, we would soon be burnt out. Imagine having to very carefully think every morning, in every detail,  about what to eat, what to wear, how to go to work etc.

But those shortcuts come with a price. When biases kick in, they can distort our thinking. I'm saying it again because it is important: **Cognitive biases distort our thinking.**

There is nothing wrong with taking shortcut in itself. Biases are meant to increase our mental efficiency. It becomes a problem when we take the wrong path while doing so. Biases are what cause us to take the wrong path.

The good news is that we can limit biases impact on our thinking. We can limit it to a certain extent.

The bad news is that it's hard. It is fucking hard. There is even biases known for making it harder. (Yes, I'm looking at you, Blind Spot bias.)

The maybe-good-maybe-bad-depending-whether-you-are-a-good-or-an-evil-person news is that you can take advantage of biases in your daily life.

The first step to conquer biases is to know them and be able to recognize them. So I will be posting more article that will focus on some biases specifically. But before that, a little bit of background.

## Where does biases come from?

We have two ways of thinking: Daniel Kahneman [^1] call them System 1 and System 2. I will refer to them as Fast Thinking and Slow Thinking respectively. 

Fast thinking is fast (Am I serious?) but more important it is intuitive. Fast Thinking is applied effortlessly. It is built from automating our thinking process. What we call instinct also falls under the Fast Thinking umbrella. Basically, every action, reaction that we have without even thinking about it are due to Fast Thinking.

Slow thinking is slow (Definitely serious!) and require focus. It is controlled thinking and require effort. It also require resources : Time, interest, informations, cognitive capacity, etc.

Being the lazy simians we are, we tend to prefer Fast Thinking, especially if we don't have all the resources for Slow Thinking. The less resources we have, the more we turn to Fast Thinking. And that's where things turn sour. Because the faster we think, the more we fall for biases.

Before going further, let's be clear about a few things : 
* Fast Thinking doesn't always lead to poor decision.
* Slow Thinking doesn't always lead to great decision. 
* There is no clear line between Fast and Slow Thinking. 
* Slow Thinking can lead to error due to biases too, it is less common because you will tend to be more rational when Slow Thinking, but it can and do happen.

Now, imagine a mountain. You are at the bottom. You need to go to a specific place. You can take the road. But mountain roads are long and winding. You don't have a car, and you don't have much time to reach the place so you decide to cut through fields. And since it's a mountain you first intuitive thinking is "hey, I don"t know where the place is, but the mountain is 2500 meters height so the place must be 1500 meters maybe. Except the place is 900 meters. 
I'm a nice person, so here is a drawing:
![Image](../_imgs/mountain_bias.jpg?raw=true)

Slow thinking was taking the road. Long, painful, but eventually you would have arrived because you would have checked the road and road sign and took the time to think through the process.

Fast thinking could have been right if you had not been misled by your error. You would just have looked at your destination and estimated it correctly because you are good at estimating distance. You would have reached it easily, crossing fields and saying hi to cows.

But there was an error. The anchor bias kicked in. Instead of looking at the place from the bottom, and estimating correctly, you started by reminding yourself the mountain was 2500 meters. Which is absolutely irrelevant for you. But it did create an anchor. And you estimated wrongly the place's height because of that irrelevant value that tend to increase the value you were estimating. 

You could have slowed your thinking a little bit and go: OK the mountain is 2500 meters height AND the place is approximatively at a third of the mountain therefor is should be around 800/900 meters. But you went with Fast Thinking (estimating the height) with an irrelevant piece of information polluting your thinking.

Biases are exactly this. Mental mistake that distort our thinking. Adding the mountain height to the informations at hand was a mistake. And sometimes it can lead to poor decisions. Like going up 1500 meters when you should have gone up 900 meters.

When we are Fast Thinking, we don't stop to question our assumption, we don't pause to check how relevant our informations for the problem are. We take them for granted, and use them to decide. And that is why biases are both so common and so hard to catch. When deciding, we don't and can't stop to see if our decision is rational, we just have to decide. Period.

OK so basically, biases are mental mistakes and we can hardly spot them on the spot. Now what?

## How to tackle biases?

You can't avoid biases. 
You're welcome. 
Bye.

Just kidding. Well not that much. Let's start with the bad new this time.
There is no universal way to avoid all biases altogether. 
Biases exist. And we are suffering from them.

There is some common step, but each bias is specific. And needs specific control. 
The only way to get rid of a bias, is to know it, and to recognize it before falling for it. 
Knowing them is easy. 
Recognizing them in other is easy too. 
But seeing them in you... That's hard. 
And catching them BEFORE they catch you... That's the hardest part. But it can be done.


Where do we start :

First and most important step is to admit that you have biases. **You have biases.** Don't negotiate with that. You have them. And it's OK. I have them too you know.

Second step, almost as important, you can't fight every biases and you SHOULD NOT try to. I'm repeating this one : **Do not try to fight every biases.** The only way to not have biases at all is to turn to Slow Thinking for every single decision. You don't have time for that bullshit. And you will end up with decision burn out. I've been there. It didn't end well. Instead you should review on a regular basis what decision went through Fast Thinking and consider switching to Slow Thinking when appropriate. You don't need to go Slow Thinking to find the tea you want to drink right now. You can go Slow Thinking when buying a box of two month of tea bags.

Third step, recognize the bias that you fall for more often or more easily. Then recognize their consequences on your life. Is it good ? Is it bad ? Both ? Is it worth fighting it? If not move to the next one. If yes, focus on this one, and build a habit to avoid it.

Fourth step, focus on one bias at a time. Nothing more to add, you'll have to trust me on this one. If you don't and succeed anyway, please let me know how you did. 

Fifth step, read my other articles about biases. I will cover them one bias (or group of close/related biases) at a time, give key to recognize them, situation where they frequently appear and solution to avoid them or reduce their negative impact on your decisions and judgments.

Fifth bis step, research biases on your favorite search engine. There is so much to say about each biases et soooooo many biases, I won't cover everything.

Sixth step, enjoy being a better person than yesterday and share your knowledges.

## Why should I get ride of biases?

We often hear about biases as a bad thing. But we just said that biases exist, are hard to fight and can sometime be beneficial or not that bad. So why should we avoid them ?

Well first refer to step three. Sometime it is not worth fighting it. And that is entirely up to you. Who you want to be, how you want to act or react or judge or appreciate situations in your life.

Some reasons why you might want to fight them are :

- Some people (like bankers, salespersons, medias etc.) try to use ways to take advantage of those biases. Avoiding the bias allows you to make a rational decision in those situations where people want you not to do so.

- Biases distort your judgment on people or situation. Which can lead to missed opportunity, interpersonal trouble etc.

- Fighting some biases will definitely make your life better. When I started focusing on attributional biases it was night and day. I became way more relaxed about things that used to enraged me. I'm pretty sure I avoided dying young from a heart attack thanks to that.

## Before you go

A few extras before you go :

- Fast thinking is designed to find really fast what is the best solution. Always remember that the best solution at this time, in this context might not be a most suitable solution overall. "Suitable" won't change. If the solution perfectly fits the problem it will always perfectly fits it. "Best" always depends on context. It seems counter intuitive, but for a solution to be the best it needs to have a worse solution. And in a thinking process that is flawed (like when you have bias for example), you can't be sure that the best solution really is the best. Please keep that in mind.

- We tend to consider our brain to be an amazing tool. It is not. It is flawed as fuck. And even when we know it and study it, we still can't avoid its flaws.

- Slow Thinking is mentally exhausting. Don't push too hard. When it's time to stop, it's time to stop.

- Fun fact about biases: Some research show that animals may have biases too. [^2] But it seems that most animal research may not have the process to avoid biases like human research do. [^3] So the question is: Do animal have biases or is it the scientists doing those research? Or both? Science is so funny!

[^1]: Daniel Kahneman is a psychologist and economist who wrote "Thinking Fast and Slow". He was part of those who uncover the concept of biases. He also won a Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences for his work challenging the idea that human are rational when dealing with money. Post studies show that he was right. Check out more about him and his work, it's definitely worth it.
[^2]:  It seems that biases have been shown in species like rats, dogs, rhesus macaques, sheep, chicks, starlings and honeybees, check out wikipedia's article about "Cognitive bias in animals". It's surprising.
[^3]: It seems that is has improve in the last decade, but in 2008 a paper shows that two third of the research on animals didn't report any measures to reduce biases impact. Now do they do it without reporting it or do they not do it at all that's another question.
